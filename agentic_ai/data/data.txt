Table: Projects
Description: Stores metadata about telecom projects including identification, market context, site type, and planned vs. actual timelines.
- project_id: Unique surrogate project identifier used as the primary key for analytics and de-duplication across systems. Identifier used to uniquely reference projects/sites for joins and reporting.
- market: Categorical label for the geographical or business market in which the project is executed. Used for segmentation, grouping, and regional analysis.
- site_type: Classification of site setup. Either "Raw Land" (new site) or "Colocation" (adding equipment to an existing site). Key for comparing deployment types.
- start_date: Actual project initiation date. Baseline for duration calculations and variance analysis.
- end_date_planned: Scheduled completion date for the project. Used to measure delays or schedule adherence.
- end_date_actual: Actual completion date once finished. Critical for measuring delay or variance against planned timelines.

Table: Agents
Description: Defines functional teams or agents responsible for executing milestones within projects.
- agent_id: Unique surrogate identifier for each agent/team. Primary key for mapping milestones to responsible groups.
- agent_name: Human-readable name of the team (e.g., "RF / Engineering", "Construction"). Used in reporting and accountability tracking.
- description: Free-text narrative describing the responsibilities of the agent/team. Provides context for qualitative analysis.

Table: Milestones
Description: Captures intermediate tasks or deliverables within projects, tied to agents and scheduled with planned/actual timelines.
- milestone_id: Unique surrogate identifier for each milestone. Primary key for referencing milestones.
- project_id: Foreign key to Projects. Links each milestone to its parent project.
- agent_id: Foreign key to Agents. Identifies which agent/team owns this milestone.
- milestone_name: Descriptive name of the milestone (e.g., "Zoning Approved", "Lease Signed").
- planned_date: Scheduled milestone completion date. Baseline expectation for analysis.
- actual_date: Date the milestone was actually achieved. Key for delay or efficiency measurement.
- status: Categorical field describing progress. Must be one of Pending, In Progress, Complete, Delayed.
- duration_days: Numeric measure of milestone execution length. Used for cycle and efficiency analysis.
- anomaly_flag: Boolean flag indicating whether this milestone deviated significantly (late, missing, inconsistent).

Table: Dependencies
Description: Tracks prerequisite relationships between milestones, allowing modeling of task ordering and dependencies.
- dependency_id: Unique surrogate identifier for the dependency record.
- milestone_id: Foreign key pointing to the dependent milestone.
- prerequisite_id: Foreign key pointing to the prerequisite milestone that must complete first.
- dependency_type: Text label describing type of dependency (e.g., Prerequisite, Predecessor, Successor). Used to build dependency graphs.

Table: Vendors
Description: Catalog of external vendors engaged in project execution.
- vendor_id: Unique surrogate identifier for each vendor. Primary key.
- vendor_name: Human-readable unique vendor name (e.g., "Vendor A"). Used in reporting, join tables, and accountability.
- role: Text description of the vendorâ€™s responsibility in the project (e.g., "Site Acquisition", "Construction").

Table: Milestone_Vendors
Description: Join table mapping milestones to vendors, enabling many-to-many associations between vendors and project tasks.
- milestone_id: Foreign key to Milestones. Identifies the milestone where the vendor was engaged.
- vendor_id: Foreign key to Vendors. Identifies the vendor involved.
- contribution: Text notes on vendor involvement. Adds context beyond structured IDs.
- Primary Key: Composite of (milestone_id, vendor_id). Ensures uniqueness.

Table: Anomalies
Description: Captures issues, exceptions, or abnormal patterns identified during milestone execution.
- anomaly_id: Unique surrogate identifier for each anomaly record.
- milestone_id: Foreign key to Milestones. Associates anomaly with a specific milestone.
- type: Category of anomaly (e.g., "Missing Date", "Long Duration", "Vendor Delay", "Out-of-Order Dependency").
- description: Text narrative explaining anomaly details. Provides qualitative context.
- severity: Ordinal label (Low, Medium, High) describing business impact of anomaly.
- detected_on: Timestamp marking when the anomaly was logged. Used for trend monitoring.

Table: Cycle_Times
Description: Tracks cycle durations across pairs of agents within a project, useful for end-to-end efficiency analysis.
- cycle_id: Unique surrogate identifier for each cycle record.
- project_id: Foreign key to Projects. Associates the cycle with a specific project.
- agent_start_id: Foreign key to Agents. Identifies the starting agent of the cycle.
- agent_end_id: Foreign key to Agents. Identifies the ending agent of the cycle.
- planned_duration: Numeric planned cycle duration (in days).
- actual_duration: Numeric actual cycle duration (in days).
- variance: Difference between actual and planned duration. Used for efficiency scoring.
